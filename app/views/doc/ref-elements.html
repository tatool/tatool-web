<h2>Elements</h2>

<p>An Element is used to group your Executables in different ways. For example, lets say you'd like to execute <i>Executable A</i> followed by <i>Executable B</i>. You can use a List Element for this purpose which allows you to execute the containing Executables in sequence. Elements can also be nested allowing you to create complex execution sequences. The number of executions (i.e., iterations) are configured on the level of Elements.</p>

<p>Tatool currently supports the following Elements with its Module Editor:</p>
<ul id="docPageNav">
  <li><i class="fa fa-angle-right"></i> <a href ng-click="scrollTo('list')">List Element</a></li>
  <li><i class="fa fa-angle-right"></i> <a href ng-click="scrollTo('dual')">Dual Element</a></li>
</ul>

<hr class="hr-red">

<h3 id="list">List Element<span class="pull-right"><a href ng-click="scrollTo('top')"><i class="fa fa-caret-up fa-lg"></i></a></span></h3>

<p>A List Element can contain any number of Elements or Executables that will be executed sequentially (one after another in the order as they are listed) for a specified number of times. For example, the Module in the Figure below consists of a ListElement 1 which contains Executable A, Executable B and another ListElement 2 which in turn contains n more Executables. Note that ListElement 1 is set to 3 iterations. Therefore, Tatool would execute the Module in sequential order for three times.</p>

<p>The execution sequence of the example above would be as follows:</p>
<p>[ListElement 1: <b>Iteration 1</b>] > Executable A > Executable B > [ListElement 2] > ...
<br>[ListElement 1: <b>Iteration 2</b>] > Executable A > Executable B > [ListElement 2] > ...
<br>[ListElement 1: <b>Iteration 3</b>] > Executable A > Executable B > [ListElement 2] > ...</p>

<h3 id="dual">Dual Element<span class="pull-right"><a href ng-click="scrollTo('top')"><i class="fa fa-caret-up fa-lg"></i></a></span></h3>

<p>The Dual Element allows you to implement the execution scenario needed for a dual task (e.g., the <a ui-sref="doc({page: 'lib-brown-peterson.html'})">Brown-Peterson task</a> in Tatool's Task Library). As their name implies, dual tasks are combinations of two distinct tasks (e.g., a digit span and a parity judgment task). Instead of having to implement these two tasks within one single Executable (what would make the code unnecessarily complex and difficult to reuse), the Dual Element allows you to easily combine two separate Executables. This involves setting a primary and a secondary Executable/Element. The default execution order is primary > secondary > primary. For example, the first execution of the primary element is the presentation of a list of digits to be memorised, followed by one or more executions of a secondary parity judgment task. Afterward, the primary Executable is executed again, prompting the user to recall the digits memorised in the beginning.</p>

<p>The Figure below illustrates the default sequence of events in a Dual Element. The complete DualElement 1 is iterated two times, reflecting two trials. Executable A is selected as primary element (1), and Executable B as secondary element (2). In this Figure, Executable B is executed only once. To execute it multiple times, use a ListElement as secondary element that contains Executable B and is iterated for as many times as you like it to.</p>

<p>

  <i>Example Dual Element</i>
</p>

<p>The execution sequence of the example above would be as follows:</p>
<p>[DualElement 1: <b>Iteration 1</b>] > Executable A > Executable B > Executable A
<br>[DualElement 1: <b>Iteration 2</b>] > Executable A > Executable B > Executable A</p>

<p>Some tasks, such as the <a ui-sref="doc({page: 'lib-complex-span.html'})">Complex Span task</a>, require switching multiple times between the primary and the secondary element before executing the final phase of the primary element. Following the example from above, this would mean that each memorandum (i.e., execution of the primary element) is followed by a parity judgment (i.e., execution of the secondary element), and then followed by the next memorandum (i.e., switching back to the primary element again). Only after all memoranda have been presented, the primary element enters the recall phase.</p>

<p>The Dual Element allows for such additional recursion (i.e., switching several times back and forth between the primary and the secondary element) by calling the <code>suspend()</code> method (available in the executableUtils service) instead of the usual <code>stop()</code> method as part of the primary Executable. As long as you call the <code>suspend()</code> method, the Dual Element will execute the secondary Element and come back to the primary Element. One iteration is finished as soon as you call <code>stop()</code> on the primary Element. To see an example for how to implement the <code>suspend()</code> method, have a look at the <a ui-sref="doc({page: 'lib-memory-span.html'})">Memory Span task</a> in Tatool's task library.
