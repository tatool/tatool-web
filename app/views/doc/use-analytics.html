<h2>Analytics</h2>

<p>The tab <i>Analytics</i> allows researchers to monitor their modules and to download the data collected. Researchers can select modules they previously added to their <i>Repository</i> via drop-down menu (<b>1</b>). While public modules are always anonymised by using an internal user codes, researchers can choose whether they want to run their experiment in blind mode (using codes as well) or whether they want to list users by email adress (<b>2</b>). For each individual, Session data can be inspected and downloaded in form of zipped CSV files (<b>3</b>). Once an experiment is over and all data is downloaded, the module can be deleted from Analytics (<b>4</b>). Note that this irreversible step deletes all data from the web server.</p>
