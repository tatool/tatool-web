Welcome to **tatool-web** - an open-source experiment software for researchers.

This framework builds on top of the ideas of our original Tatool Java-based client ([see our paper](http://link.springer.com/article/10.3758%2Fs13428-012-0224-y)), but was completely rewritten in JavaScript/HTML/CSS and of course improved and simplified.

Check out our documentation in order to learn more.
